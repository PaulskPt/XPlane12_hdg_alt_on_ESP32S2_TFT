# XPlane12_hdg_alt_on_ESP32S2_TFT
 

This is a first attempt to display X-Plane 12 udp datagram packet details onto an Adafruit Feather ESP32-S2-TFT device.
The scripts are derived from earlier similar projects for other devices.
In this example only the aircraft flight heading and its altitude are displayed on the TFT display of the feather ESP32-S2-TFT.
You can modify the scripts to display other flight parameters e.g.: current position or groundspeed.

You have to set your personal WiFi settings into the file settings.toml.
